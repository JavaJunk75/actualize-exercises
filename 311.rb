# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

#Write a program that uses variables to store two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.

number1 = 7
number2 = 25
puts number1 + number2

#Yes, was able to complete easily from memory.
#Will start on the next problem
